# NEON PHASE

This is a video game, created along with [GlitchedPuppet](http://glitchedpuppet.com/), set in their [Flora](http://floraverse.com/) world.  It was made in a week — err, nineish days — for the [Games Made Quick](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick) jam.  It's based on the code from my (incomplete as of this writing) game, [Isaac's Descent: HD Remix](https://github.com/eevee/isaacs-descent).

It requires [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10 and nothing else.


## Running

You can get a build from [the page on itch](https://eevee.itch.io/neon-phase).

Or install LÖVE and run this repository with it.

    git clone https://github.com/eevee/neon-phase
    love neon-phase
